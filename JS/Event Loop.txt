DEFINITION :

Event Loop is a core mechanism within the JavaScript runtime environment responsible for handling
asynchronous operation It allows js to perform tasks without blocking main thread, facilatating non-blocking
I/O oeprations.


WHY WE NEED IT :

- To handle asynchronous oeprations
- to prevent main thread to be non blocking
- to support concurrency
- Efficiently utilzing the resources

HOW IT WORKS (High Level) :
- When a function is created, it remembers the lexical scope (variables available at creation time).

- If this inner function is returned or used later, it still has access to those outer variables even after 
  the outer function has executed.

- JavaScript’s runtime keeps these variables in memory as long as the inner function needs them.

KEY COMPONENTS :
- Call Stack – The call stack is a LIFO (Last In, First Out) structure that stores the function calls 
                currently being executed. When a function is called, it gets pushed onto the stack; 
                upon completion, it is popped off.

- Task Queue – The task queue stores all the tasks waiting to be executed, typically asynchronous 
                operation callbacks like those from setTimeout, setInterval, and I/O operations. 
                When the call stack is empty, the event loop takes a task from the task queue and pushes 
                it onto the call stack.

- Microtask Queue – The microtask queue stores all waiting microtasks, such as Promise callbacks and 
                    MutationObserver callbacks. It has a higher priority than the task queue. 
                    When the call stack is empty, the event loop first processes all tasks in the 
                    microtask queue before handling those in the task queue.

LIMITATIONS

- CPU-Heavy Tasks Block the Thread
- No True Parallel Execution of JS Code
- Long-Running Tasks Reduce Responsiveness
- Callback Queue Overload
